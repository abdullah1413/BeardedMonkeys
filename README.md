### Hafiz Temuri
Hi, I am Hafiz Temuri and I am a computer science student. I used to be crazy passionate about ethical hacking since I was in high school, and that lead me computer science. Once I got into the field, I become more interested in web design and development.

I have been using core web languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery for quite a few years. Also, I am a great supporter of WordPress, that means I like to design/develop it's templates and plugins. I am a huge fan of Adobe Creative Design, and I use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premier Pro, InDesign depending on the project. My knowledge of programming language extend to Python, C language, Java, Ruby, VB.net PHP and SQL. I just like to taste everything.

You can checkout my current websites to know me better, http://www.webpro.tech/ and https://www.searchbeast.ca/
